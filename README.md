# store-visitors-data-pipeline
This project focuses on the end-to-end process of generating, retrieving, transforming, and visualizing store visitor data. The core objective is to simulate realistic visitor count data for multiple stores, expose this data through a GET API, and create a comprehensive dashboard for insights using Streamlit.
